## Questions and Hypotheses

### Comparison of Vehicle Types:

- **Question:** How do sedans, wagons, and sports cars compare in terms of weight, horsepower, and mpg?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** There is no significant difference in weight, horsepower, and mpg among sedans, wagons, and sports cars.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** There are significant differences in weight, horsepower, and mpg among sedans, wagons, and sports cars.

- **Question:** Are sports cars generally heavier and more powerful compared to sedans?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** Sports cars are not significantly heavier nor more powerful than sedans.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** Sports cars are significantly lighter and more powerful than sedans.

### Country of Origin Analysis:

- **Question:** How do vehicles from different countries of origin compare in terms of displacement and acceleration?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** There is no significant difference in displacement and acceleration among vehicles from different countries of origin.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** There are significant differences in displacement and acceleration among vehicles from different countries of origin.

- **Question:** Are there noticeable differences in vehicle characteristics based on the country of origin?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** There are no noticeable differences in vehicle characteristics based on the country of origin.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** There are noticeable differences in vehicle characteristics based on the country of origin.

### Weight Differences by Origin:

- **Question:** How does the weight of vehicles differ by origin?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** There is no significant difference in the weight of vehicles by origin.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** There is a significant difference in the weight of vehicles by origin.

- **Question:** Are vehicles from Germany generally heavier than those from Japan?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** Vehicles from Germany are not significantly heavier than those from Japan.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** Vehicles from Germany are significantly heavier than those from Japan.

### Model Year and MPG:

- **Question:** How does the mpg of vehicles vary across different model years?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** There is no significant variation in mpg across different model years.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** There is significant variation in mpg across different model years.

- **Question:** Are there any noticeable trends in mpg over the model years in the dataset?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** There are no noticeable trends in mpg over the model years in the dataset.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** There are noticeable upward trends in mpg over the model years in the dataset.

### Vehicle Characteristics by Origin:

- **Question:** How do vehicles from different origins (USA, Germany, Japan) compare in terms of mpg, weight, and horsepower?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** There is no significant difference in mpg, weight, and horsepower among vehicles from different origins.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** There are significant differences in mpg, weight, and horsepower among vehicles from different origins.

- **Question:** Are vehicles from Japan generally more fuel-efficient compared to those from the USA?

  - **Null Hypothesis $(H0)$:** Vehicles from Japan are not significantly more fuel-efficient compared to those from the USA.
  - **Alternate Hypothesis $(H1)$:** Vehicles from Japan are significantly more fuel-efficient compared to those from the USA.
